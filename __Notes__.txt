28 August 2025 - Project idea definition
- don't forget to check all the remarks from the submited projects
- start with a template folder and helper functions
- define and create a database structure

Project Idea Definition:
Build a smart closet that can easily manage the food products bought by a user.
Features:
 - the main purpose and feature of this application is monitoring expiration dates of the products and 
   informing the user so that the product is used before expiration, and thus reducing the waste
 - quick, easy and reliable insertion of data in the database (this can be achieved with scaning a barcode provided by the shop or farmacy). 
   The barcode should include at least information such as product name or product id, price and expiration date, for all the bought products.
   The rest of the information can be taken from an API (information such as nutrion value, image)
 - providing the user with a beautiful and easy to use interface
 - considering the food products that will expire soon, the application could provide the user with a list of recipes (and also consider diets)
 - products removal is done either manually or automaticatlly when a provided recipe is accepted by the user
Extra:
 - this application can be expanded to other product types as well (medication, cleaning products, licenses, etc.)
 - easy integrating with a Home assistant
 - detect trends in products usage, and provide the user with promotions from their favourite shops and farmacies
 - find a smarter and more reliable way to remove products from the active list

29 August 2025 - Project idea definition

 - categories as a list?
 - product price inside closet products
 - link stores to closet products
 - fix the tables relationships (one-2-one, one-2-many)

consider using an OCR for reading receipts and inserting the data directly in the database
